In folders ChildCalendar, Message, Parent, Teacher are located various testsuites.

Every testsuite (file begins with ts_) starts with the login-testcase (tc_loginParent or tc_loginTeacher) at login-page: http://localhost:8080/login.xhtml, and ends with the logout-testcase (tc_logout) - end-viewpoint: http://localhost:8080/login.xhtml.

Every testcase (file begins with tc_), except testcases in ChildCalendar, starts at welcome-page: http://localhost:8080/secured/welcome.xhtml.


Please make sure, you take a low speed for running the testsuite. There are no "waitFor" so for example when a button is to be clicked which is not already available, the test will fail.
